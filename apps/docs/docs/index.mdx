# Welcome to Stylex

StyleX is a simple and easy to use CSS-in-JS library that gives you the
developer experience of using inline styles in Javascript combined with the
performance of static atomic styles.

## Stylex in 5 minutes

Using StyleX should feel no different than using Inline Styles directly. You
define your styles and use them. That's it!

#### Define Styles

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  // base styles
  main: {
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: 800,
    minHeight: 40,
  },
  // conditional styles
  active: {
    transform: 'scale(0.9)',
  },
});
```

#### Use Styles on an HTML element

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({ ... });
// Use styles
<div
  className={stylex(
    // Use base styles
    styles.main,
    // Use styles if a condition is true
    isActive && styles.active,
    // Use styles passed in as a prop
    props.xstyle,
  )}
/>;
```

The example above uses JSX, StyleX itself is framework agnostic. For example,
here is how you would use StyleX with an `html` template literal in Lit HTML:

```tsx
return html`<div
  class=${stylex(
    // Use base styles
    styles.main,
    // Use styles if a condition is true
    isActive && styles.active,
    // Use styles passed in as a prop
    props.xstyle,
  )} />`;
```

While the API is expressive all styles are compiled into atomic classNames and
bundled into a single CSS file. This means that you get the ease of use and
expressiveness of Inline Styles without sacrificing performance.

## Features At a glance

### Expressive

- Easy-to-use API that is as simple as Inline styles
- Apply styles conditionally
- Merge and compose arbitrary styles across component and file boundaries.
- Use local constants and expressions to keep your styles DRY
- Or repeat yourself without worrying about performance
- Ability to use dynamic styles when you really need them with minimal overhead.
- Expressive and simple API for theming with CSS variables

### Predictable

- "The last style always wins!" - StyleX will always give you predictable
  results
  - No need to worry about using CSS shorthands vs specific styles
  - No need to think about specificity of Media Queries or Pseudo Classes
- Style Encapsulation - All styles are caused by classNames set on an elemnt
  directly.
  - Complex selectors never "style at a distance"

### Fast

- Uses Atomic Styles to generate the minimum set of rules possible.
- All CSS is generated at compile time into a single bundle
  - No runtime style injection
  - No style recalculation to due to repeated lazy loading of styles at runtime

- **Static** - Does the library generate CSS at compile time?
- **Atomic** - Does the library generate atomic CSS?
- **Style Format** - What format are styles authored in? Strings, Objects, or
  separate CSS files.
- **Co-location** - Are the styles in the same file as your component?
- **Composition** - Can you compose and merge styles across component
  boundaries? Can you pass styles as props?
- **Dynamic Styles** - Are dynamic values for styles possible.
- **Types** - Are the authored styles typed? Can constrain what styles are
  passed to components with static types?

## Roadmap

StyleX is _not_ complete. Here is an (incomplete) list of things that still need
to be done.

- The ESLint plugin does not catch all invalid values and is a weak replacement
  for stylelint. Lots of improvements are coming over time.
- There is no ESLint plugin to catch unused styles yet. Coming soon.
- Complex selectors involving descendant selectors, sibling selectors, etc. are
  not supported yet.
- The API for theming with CSS variables is unstable and may change.
- Official plugin for various meta-frameworks like NextJS, Nuxt, SvelteKit,
  Vite, etc. are either unstable or non-existent for now.
