# Defining and using styles

In order be as familiar as possible, StyleX uses an API that is very reminiscent
of React Native which, in turn, gives you an experience very close to that of
using inline styles in React.

## Defining styles

Defining styles is as simple as using the `stylex.create` function to define a
one or more “namespaces” or objects of styles. The Styles are defined as
Javascript objects. (See [[Why JS Objects and not a CSS string]])

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: 'rgb(60,60,60)',
  },
  highlighted: {
    color: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
});
```

Here we have defined two objects of styles, that we refer to as “namespaces”,
called `base` and `highlighted`. The names of these namespaces are arbitrary and
so is the name for the constant used to capture the result of the function call
itself.

## Using styles

Once styles have been defined, they can be converted to classNames using the
`stylex` function and used as the `className` prop of any HTML element.

```tsx
<div {...stylex.spread(styles.base)} />

// Legacy API (Doesn't support Dynamic Styles)
<div className={stylex(styles.base)} />
```

While this is the simplest case, it is trivial to merge multiple style objects,
use them conditionally, or even compose styles across module boundaries. We will
look at that next.

### Making Ahead-of-Time compilation possible

Since `StyleX` depends on ahead-of-time compilation, it is important for all
your styles to be statically analyzable. This means that your `Raw Style Object`
may only contain:

- Plain object literals
- String Literals
- Number Literals
- Array Literals
- `null` or `undefined`
- contants containing any of the above
- Simple expressions combining any of the above such as:
  - `const fontSize = 32 / 16 + 'rem';`
- Certain common methods available on Strings and Numbers
  - e.g. `.toUpperCase()`

More specifically, the following are **not** allowed:

- Function calls _(we're working on limited support for functions)_
- Values imported from other modules
  - (except when it comes to CSS Variables created using StyleX in a
    `.stylex.js` file)
