# Dynamic Styles

:::warning

This feature is experimental and there may be bugs and breaking changes in the
future.

:::

:::warning

Dynamic styles are an advanced feature and should be used sparingly. For the
majority of use-cases,
[conditional styles](/docs/getting-started/defining-and-using-styles/) should be
sufficient.

:::

StyleX generates all styles at compile-time which means you need to _know_ all
those styles ahead of time as well. But sometimes you just don't know what you
will need until runtime. For example, you may be styling a bar chart where the
bar changes colors based on the data.

Usually, you need to resort to using inline styles for something like this. This
comes with some big downsides, including:

- Inability to use pseudo-classes or media queries
- Inline Styles have a much higher specificity and overriding them with static
  styles can be problematic.

StyleX provides a way to define styles that can have dynamic values resolved at
runtime by using functions instead of objects to define styles.

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: (r, g, b) => ({
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`,
  }),
});

const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);

<div {...stylex.spread(styles.base(r, g, b))} />;
```

**NOTE**: The function body _must_ be an object literal. You cannot use a
function body with multiple statements.

:::warning

If you use this pattern, StyleX will generate a combination of classNames and
Inline styles and you _must_ use the `stylex.spread()` (and not `stylex()`) to
apply them.

:::

## How it works

Behind the scenes, StyleX generates a combination of classNames and inline
styles. However, to maintain the same guarantees as static styles, the only
inline styles that are generated are to define values of inline styles.

This enables you to use all the same features of StyleX, including pseudo
classes and media queries.
