# Dynamic Styles (Coming Soon)

:::warning

This feature has been implemented on an experimental branch, but is not yet
available yet.

:::warning

Dynamic styles are an advanced feature and should be used sparingly. When you
use them ask if you absolutely cannot know the value or a list of possible
values at build-time.

:::

StyleX generates all styles at compile-time which means you need to _know_ all
those styles ahead of time as well. But sometimes you just don't know what you
will need until runtime. For example, you may be styling a bar chart where the
bar changes colors based on the data.

In most other styling solutions, you need to resort to using inline styles for
something like this. This comes with some big downsides, including:

- Inability to use pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus`
- Inability to use media queries

In the context of StyleX, using inline styles directly would also break the
predictability that you get when merging styles.

CSS variables are a great solution to all of these problems. Instead of setting
arbitrary styles as inline styles, you can set CSS variables and then use those
variables in your styles.

This is exactly what StyleX does _under the hood_. All _you_ have to do is use a
function instead of an object when defining your styles.

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: (r, g, b) => ({
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`,
  }),
});

const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);

<div {...stylex.spread(styles.base(r, g, b))} />;
```

:::warning

If you use this pattern, StyleX will generate a combination of classNames and
Inline styles and you _must_ use the `stylex.spread()` (and not `stylex()`) to
apply them.
