# Installation

StyleX uses ahead of time compilation to give you the best performance possible
despite its expressive and powerful API. This tradeoff means that the build
process is a bit more involved than other CSS-in-JS libraries.

## Getting Started in Development

To start playing with StyleX without having to set up any build settings you can
install just two packages:

<DevInstallExample
  prod={[`@stylexjs/stylex`]}
  dev={[`@stylexjs/dev-runtime`]}
/>

In order to make it easy to get started, you can simply import
`@stylexjs/dev-runtime` in your JS entry-point to set everything up.

```ts
import inject from '@stylexjs/dev-runtime';

inject({
  // configuration options
  dev: true,
  test: false,
  classNamePrefix: 'x-',
  definedStylexCSSVariables: {
    primary: {
      lightMode: 'black',
      darkMode: 'white',
    },
  },
});
```

Once this is done, you can start importing and using `@stylexjs/stylex` without
any further setup until you're ready to deploy to production.

:::warning

You should not use `@stylexjs/dev-runtime` in production. It has a significant
performance cost and should only be used for development.

:::

## Using ESLint to catch common mistakes

StyleX will often compile invalid styles. You should use the ESlint plugin to
catch these mistakes when you author your styles.

<DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/eslint-plugin`]} />

You can then add the plugin to your ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@stylexjs"],
  "rules": {
    "@stylexjs/valid-styles": 2,
  },
};
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to use StyleX in production, you will need to set up a build
configuration to generate a static stylesheet at compile time and remove the
runtime cost of injecting styles that is a common pitfall of many other
CSS-in-JS libraries.

StyleX provides a Babel plugin along with plugins for Webpack, Rollup and
NextJS.

Assuming you're using Rollup, you will need these additional packages:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Babel" value="babel">
    <DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/babel-plugin`]} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Rollup" value="rollup">
    <DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/rollup-plugin`]} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Webpack" value="webpack">
    <DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/webpack-plugin`]} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Meta-Frameworks

We have a growing list of example projects to help you get started with using
StyleX within your favourite meta-framework.

#### NextJS (`pages` directory)

<DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/nextjs-plugin`]} />

#### NextJS (`app` directory)

To use StyleX in your NextJS using the `app` directory, you can close this
example projects or copy the relevant configuration files.
