# Ideal conditions for using StyleX?

StyleX works well in a wide variety of projects, and you will usually not regret
choosing it.

However, there are some conditions that are more ideal for using StyleX than
others.

## When authoring your UI in Javascript

StyleX is a CSS-in-JS library, which means that it is most useful when you are
authoring your UI in Javascript. If you're using a framework such as `React`,
`Preact`, `Solid`, `Lit`, or `Angular`, using StyleX should be a breeze.

Some frameworks, such as Svete and Vue use custom file formats that are compiled
to Javascript at build time. StyleX can still be used in these frameworks, but
may need some extra configuration.

There are also UI solutions such as `htmx` and various templating engines where
you author your markup in files that can't contain arbitrary Javascript. Even if
you can make StyleX work in these environments, it may not be worth the effort.

## Large or growing projects

While StyleX works well for projects of all sizes, it really shines in larger
applications.

Since StyleX compiles to atomic class names, a big performance benefit is that
the size of your CSS bundle plateaus as your project grows.

For smaller projects, it may still make sense to choose StyleX for its
expressive API, but the performance benefits may not be as meaningful.

## Reusable components

StyleX makes the most sense when being used alongside reusable UI components.

For years, we have had to choose between "Design System" components that come
with styles baked in but can be difficult to customize or "Headless" components
that are completely unstyled.

StyleX finally lets you build UI components that can have default styles _and_
still be customizable.

### NPM packages of UI components

Because StyleX is able to merge styles across components and files in a
predictable and deterministic way, it is uniquely well-suited for building
reusable UI components that can be published to NPM.

By accepting `StyleXStyles` as props, these components can, trivially, be made
fully customizable.
