# Accepting Arbitrary Styles

StyleX comes with full support for Static Types. Apart from having to use a few
helper types, the type definitions should feel no different from types used for
simple inline style objects. The most common type you might need to use is
called `StyleXStyle<>`. This lets you accept an object of arbitrary StyleX
styles.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript" default>

```tsx
type Props = {
  ...
  xstyle?: StyleXStyles,
};

function MyComponent({xstyle, ...otherProps}: Props): React.JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div
      {...stylex.spread(localStyles.foo, localStyles.bar, xstyle)}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flow" label="Flow">

```tsx
type Props = $ReadOnly<{
  ...
  xstyle?: StyleXStyles<>,
}>;

function MyComponent({xstyle, ...otherProps}: Props): React.MixedElement {
  return (
    <div
      {...stylex.spread(localStyles.foo, localStyles.bar, xstyle)}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since `xstyle` is just a regular prop, you can use an arbitrary name for it and
you can use multiple props if you want to be able accept styles for multiple
HTML elements within your component.

## Disallowing Inline Styles

When you author styles with dynamic values that cannot be known ahead of time,
the `StyleX Style` object returns contains bother atomic classNames _and_ inline
styles. The type `StyleXStyles` allows a mix of both. As such, you should
usually default to using `StyleXStyles` and `stylex.spread` in your code.

However, for the best possible performance, you can choose to disallow any
dynamic styles. For these scenarios, you can use the `StaticStyles` types
instead of `StyleXStyles`. The rest of the code can remain unchanged.

## Recommendations

Here are some recommendations for patterns to use while using StyleX. These are
not rules and you can use StyleX however you want. We make these recommendations
to help guide various codebases using StyleX into a consistent pattern.

### Use prop names that follow the pattern of `xstyle` or `fooXStyle` when accepting "StyleX Styles"

We recommend using the prop name `xstyle` for the canonical HTML element of your
component and the pattern of `*XStyle` for other externals that you accept for
your component. This will lead to a consistent pattern among components that use
StyleX and will make usage of stylex within components more predictable.

### When accepting arbitrary styles for your components, let them override your base styles.

We recommend ensuring that any styles that are passed in as props externally
override any local styles that you may have set on your custom component. This
will gives users of your component a more predictable behaviour when passing
styles in. You do this by simply passing `xstyle` as the last argument to the
`stylex()` `stylex.spread()` function.

There may, however, be situations where you don't want certain local styles to
ever be overridden. In those cases we suggest using types to block certain
styles from being passed.
