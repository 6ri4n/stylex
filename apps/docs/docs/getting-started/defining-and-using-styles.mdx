# Defining and using styles

In order be as familiar as possible, StyleX uses an API that is very reminiscent of React Native which, in turn, gives you an experience very close to that of using inline styles in React.

## Defining styles

Defining styles is as simple as using the `stylex.create` function to define a one or more “namespaces” or objects of styles. The Styles are defined as Javascript objects. (See [[Why JS Objects and not a CSS string]])

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/runtime';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: 'rgb(60,60,60)',
  },
  highlighted: {
    color: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
});
```

Here we have defined two objects of styles, that we refer to as “namespaces”, called `base` and `highlighted`. The names of these namespaces are arbitrary and so is the name for the constant used to capture the result of the function call itself.

## Using styles

Once styles have been defined, they can be converted to classNames using the `stylex` function and used as the `className` prop of any HTML element.

```tsx
import stylex from '@stylexjs/runtime';

<div className={stylex(styles.base)} />;
```

While this is the simplest case, it is trivial to merge multiple style objects, use them conditionally, or even compose styles across module boundaries. We will look at that next.
