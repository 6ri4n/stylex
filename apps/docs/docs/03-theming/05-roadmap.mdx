# Enhancement Ideas for StyleX Variables

Support for CSS variables in StyleX is unstable and incomplete. We're working on
the following enhancements to make it more useful.

### Declaring CSS `<syntax>` types for variables

Using `@property` rules, it is possible to declare the type of a CSS variable.
These types can add additional meaning to variables such as make them animatable
or restrict them to a certain range of values.

We are currently in the process of adding API to StyleX to allow declaring these
types for variables.

### Less Configuration

Today StyleX needs to be manually configuration with the root path of your
project. We are looking into ways to make this configuration automatic.

### Performance Enhancements?

There are many situations where variables may be used for a better developer
experience where they don't need to CSS variables in production. We are looking
into detecting CSS variables that are never overridden and replacing them with
their values at build time and thus reducing the CSS bundle-size and improving
performance.

### Constants?

Variables is a safe way to extract data into external modules without needing
cross-module compilation. It might be useful to have a way to declare constants
that can never be changed which can then be replaced in the generated CSS file
with their values.
