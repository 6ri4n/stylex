# Quick start

StyleX is a simple, easy to use JavaScript syntax and compiler for styling web apps.

## Features at a glance

### Expressive

- Easy-to-use API that is as simple as Inline styles
- Apply styles conditionally
- Merge and compose arbitrary styles across component and file boundaries.
- Use local constants and expressions to keep your styles DRY
- Or repeat yourself without worrying about performance
- Ability to use dynamic styles when needed with minimal overhead.
- An expressive and simple API for theming with CSS variables

### Predictable

- "The last style applied always wins!" - StyleX will always give you
  predictable results
  - No need to worry about using CSS shorthands vs specific styles
  - No need to think about specificity of Media Queries or Pseudo Classes
- Style Encapsulation - All styles are caused by classNames applied directly set
  on an element
  - Complex selectors never "style at a distance"

### Fast

- StyleX compiles styles to atomic CSS rules.
- StyleX generates a minimimal set of rules and eliminates unused styling code.
- StyleX generates CSS at build time and produces a single CSS file.
- StyleX avoids runtime style injection, and avoids sources of runtime style recalculation.


## StyleX in 5 minutes

StyleX combines the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of both inline styles and static CSS. Defining and using styles requires only local knowledge within a component, and avoids specificity issues while retaining features like Media Queries. StyleX builds optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS which is superior what could be authored and maintained by hand.

### Defining styles

Styles are defined using an object syntax and the `create()` API.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  root: {
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: 800,
    minHeight: 40,
  }
});
```

Any number of rules can be created, by using additional keys and additional calls to `create()`:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  root: {
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: 800,
    minHeight: 40,
  },
  child: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    marginBlock: '1rem'
  }
});

const colorStyles = stylex.create({
  red: {
    backgroundColor: 'lightred',
    borderColor: 'darkred'
  },
  green: {
    backgroundColor: 'lightgreen',
    borderColor: 'darkgreen'
  }
})
```

### Using styles

To use styles they must be passed to the `props()` function. Styles can be combined using an array, and applied conditionally using standard JavaScript expressions.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({ ... });

function reactDiv({ color, isActive, style }) {
  return (
    <div {...stylex.props([
      styles.main,
      // conditionals
      isActive && styles.active,
      // variants from props
      colorStyles[color]
      // styles passed as props
      style,
    ])} />
  );
```

The example above uses JSX. StyleX itself is framework agnostic. For example, here is how you would use StyleX with an `html` template literal in Lit HTML:

```tsx
import { html } from 'lit-html';
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({ ... });

function litDiv(color, isActive, style) {
  const {className, style: inlineStyle} = stylex.props([
    styles.main,
    // conditionals
    isActive && styles.active,
    // variants from arguments
    colorStyles[color],
    // styles passed as arguments
    style
  ]);

  return html`<div class=${className} style=${inlineStyle} />`;
}
```
