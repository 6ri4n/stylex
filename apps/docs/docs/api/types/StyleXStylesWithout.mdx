# `StyleXStylesWithout<>`

Allow any styles except for keys defined in the provided object type.
It works similarly to the `Omit<>` utility type.

```tsx
import {StyleXStylesWithout} from '@stylexjs/stylex/lib/StyleXTypes';

type Props = {
  // ...
  style?: StyleXStylesWithout<{
    postion: unknown,
    display: unknown,
    top: unknown,
    start: unknown,
    end: unknown,
    bottom: unknown,
    border: unknown,
    borderWidth: unknown,
    borderBottomWidth: unknown,
    borderEndWidth: unknown,
    borderStartWidth: unknown,
    borderTopWidth: unknown,
    margin: unknown,
    marginBottom: unknown,
    marginEnd: unknown,
    marginStart: unknown,
    marginTop: unknown,
    padding: unknown,
    paddingBottom: unknown,
    paddingEnd: unknown,
    paddingStart: unknown,
    paddingTop: unknown,
    width: unknown,
    height: unknown,
    flexBasis: unknown,
    overflow: unknown,
    overflowX: unknown,
    overflowY: unknown,
  }>,
};
```

This type will disallow all the keys which are known to cause layout
changes, but will continue to allow all other style properties.
