# Advanced Usage Patterns for Variables

:::danger

Theming APIs for defining and overrideing CSS variables are experimental and
subject to change.

:::

The APIs for variables are designed to be simple and easy to use, but also
scalable to support complex use-cases.

Here are some things you can do with variables in StyleX that may not be
obvious:

## You can define different variables sets for different types of tokens

StyleX enforces that you define your Variables as groups when using the
`createVars` function, but you can use the function multiple times to create
logical groups for your variables.

## You can create variables from other variables

You can use the `createVars` function to create variables from other variables.

```tsx title="heroTokens.stylex.js"
import stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {colors} from './tokens.stylex';

// A constant can be used to avoid repeating the media query
const DARK = '@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)';

export const colors = stylex.createVars({
  ctaButtonBackground: colors.accent,
  ctaButtonColor: colors.primaryText,
});
```

## You can create many themes using providers and apply them to different parts of your app

You can create many different override providers for your variables and then
apply them conditionally and dynamically to different parts of your app to
enable custom themes.
