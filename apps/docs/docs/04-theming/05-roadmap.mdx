# Enhancement Ideas for StyleX Variables

First class variable support is fairy new in StyleX and still unstable. While we
are happy with the current capabilities and experience of using variables we
have some ideas to further improve the implementation:

## Declaring CSS `<syntax>` types for variables

Using `@property` rules, it is possible to declare the type of a CSS variable.
These types can add additional meaning to variables such as make them animatable
or restrict them to a certain range of values.

We are currently in the process of adding API to StyleX to allow declaring these
types for variables.

## Less Configuration

You need to currently manually configure StyleX to provide the root directory
containing your application to be able to even use variables. We are
investigating ways to make this configuration step unnecessary by looking for
the `package.json` file automatically

## Performance Enhancements

There are many situations where variables may be used for a better developer
experience where they don't need to CSS variables in production. We are looking
into detecting CSS variables that are never overridden and replacing them with
their values at build time and thus reducing the CSS bundle-size and improving
performance.

## API for changing the default values of variables

If, in the future, NPM packages start shipping their own StyleX variables, it
might be useful not just to define overrides, but replace the default values of
variables. This would enable the performance enhancement mentioned above in more
scenarios.
