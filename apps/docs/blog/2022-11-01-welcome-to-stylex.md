I'm happy to annouce that StyleX is _finally_ available on NPM as a beta release!

# 🎉🎊🍾🥳

### First Step on a Long Journey!

Being a beta release, expect changes to happen often and without much warning. For example, We are already working on completely changing the way Media Queries and Pseudo Classes work in StyleX!

There are also a lot of things that are probably still missing. StyleX doesn't even know that CSS Grid Layout exists! The Eslint plugin might give you unexpected errors and certain CSS shorthands might not expand properly.

However, the parts of StyleX that exist today have been used in production for over two years already and you should already be able to see the great developer experience, expressive composition of styles and amazing performance of statically extracted atomic styles.

### Open Source?

Considering the missing features and upcoming API churn, we are not ready to for a stable release or for the open source community to contribute. However, we are already working with select internal and external partners and hope to make StyleX stable, and open source, soon!
