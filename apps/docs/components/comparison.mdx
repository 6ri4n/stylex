`*` - Tailwind doesn't co-locate the styles themselves, but since it uses a
special shorthand to represent styles, it is effectively the same.

- **Static** - Does the library generate CSS at compile time?
- **Atomic** - Does the library generate atomic CSS?
- **Style Format** - What format are styles authored in? Strings, Objects, or
  separate CSS files.
- **Co-location** - Are the styles in the same file as your component?
- **Composition** - Can you compose and merge styles across component
  boundaries? Can you pass styles as props?
- **Dynamic Styles** - Can you generate styles with dynamic values not known
  until runtime?
- **Typed** - Are the authored styles typed? Can constrain what styles are
  passed to components with static types? This is only relevant when composing
  styles.
