Understanding {{ site.name }} browser compatibility.
:::

{{ site.name }} is designed and tested for recent mobile and desktop browsers that support CSS custom properties.

The browsers with known support include:

* Chrome 60+
* Safari 11+ / iOS Safari 11+
* Edge 12+
* Firefox ESR+
* Opera

## CSS

Most CSS properties and values are supported. Vendor prefixes are automatically provided where necessary.

Certain CSS properties are not supported across all browsers, but are polyfilled by {{ site.name }}. For example, `marginBlock`.
